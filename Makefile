## Generate mocks for all the interfaces
mock:
	rm -rf mocks
	mockery --all --keeptree --case underscore --with-expecter --exported

## Run all the tests by excluding auto-generated/conditional packages
unit-test:
	go test ./... -mod=readonly -cover -covermode=${COVER_MODE} -coverprofile=${COVER_PROFILE} -coverpkg=${GO_COVER_PKG}

# check coverage
test-cover:
	go tool cover -func ${COVER_PROFILE}
